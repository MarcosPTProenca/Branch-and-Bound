# Branch and Bound
 Integer programming with branch and bound

> ## About The Project

This is a branch and bound method to find a integer solution to linear programming models. I did this project for the subject Pesquisa Operacional (Operational Research) available in the College Unicamp - BR. Basically branch and bound method works by creating a tree of problemns that increases the number of restrictions according to the result of the linear programming. If the variables found in the linear programming model are not integer, branch and bound creat restrictions to prevent the variables not being integer.

> ## Built With

I used python, Spyder and Visual Studio Code to implement this project
